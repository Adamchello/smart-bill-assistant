### Clarifying Questions

1. Should the bill forecasting feature rely only on user data, or should it also integrate external data (e.g., weather, market prices)?
2. How “deep” should the eco-metrics go in MVP — just basic CO₂ estimates, or detailed breakdowns?
3. Will provider suggestions be limited to a predefined list (partners/affiliates) or open to all available alternatives?
4. Are there specific regions or markets we’re targeting first (e.g., U.S., EU)?
5. Do we need multi-language support in MVP, or is English-only sufficient?
6. Should the negotiation assistant include automated sending of templates, or is copy-paste/manual sending enough for MVP?
